# Activity Recognition in Senior Citizens

## Overview
This project utilizes a dataset comprising records from 18 older adults, with ages ranging from 70 to 95 years. These individuals wore tri-axial accelerometers for 40 minutes as part of a semi-structured daily life protocol. The primary objective of this project was to develop Machine Learning models capable of predicting and classifying various activities based on sensor measurements.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Ansh Tnawar and has been retrieved from Kaggle. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/adult-subjects-70-95-years-activity-recognition). It contains valuable information recorded from older adults' daily activities.

## Methodology
To achieve our goal, we employed the Random Forest model. We utilized Jupyter Notebook with Python for the development of this solution. Our solution is heavily reliant on the following libraries: 

- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Team Members
- Diego Sú Gómez
- Estefanía Pérez Yeo
- Francisco Javier Sanchez Panduro
- Vanessa Méndez Palacios

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file in the repository.
3. Run the notebook to train and test the Machine Learning models.

## Conclusion

This project showcases how Machine Learning can be applied to recognize and classify activities based on accelerometer data from older adults. It offers valuable insights into the field of activity recognition and provides a foundation for further research and applications.
