# Activity Recognition in Senior Citizens

For this project we had a dataset composed of records from 18 older adults, aged between 70 and 95 years, who wore tri-axial accelerometers for 40 minutes in a semi-structured 
daily life protocol.The primary goal of this project was to train Machine Learning models capable of predicting and classifying different activities based on sensor measurements. 
The labels represent the actual activities recorded in each observation, forming the basis for the generation of several Machine Learning models that will be implemented later. 
To determine the optimal model, a series of procedures were carried out to ensure the reliability of the results. Once the model scores were obtained, they were classified, 
explaining the criteria used for this classification. The model considered most suitable for the dataset was Random Forest. The report provides an overview of the methodology used 
and the results obtained in the search for the most appropriate classification model for the older adults activity recognition dataset. Conclusions and interpretations are presented 
in the final section of the report.

The dataset is from Ansh Tnawar and has been retrieved from keggle, it can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/adult-subjects-70-95-years-activity-recognition).
